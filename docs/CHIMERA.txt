Abstract
Problem Statement Modern cyber attackers increasingly employ automated exploit kits, AI-driven reconnaissance, and cloud-targeting strategies, making traditional static honeypots inadequate. Passive deception systems often fail to maintain engagement long enough to extract meaningful intelligence on attacker behaviour or intent.
Proposed Solution We present CHIMERA, an adaptive deception platform that transforms passive trap networks into active, predictive environments. The system leverages Google’s AI ecosystem to analyze attacker interactions in real-time and dynamically "morph" the environment to counteract specific threats.
Technical Architecture The platform operates on a three-tier architecture:
•	Multi-Modal Honeypot Layer: To simulate a realistic enterprise infrastructure, CHIMERA coordinates three isolated environments: an SSH honeypot (Cowrie) for shell interaction, a Web/API honeypot (FastAPI) for endpoint capture, and a Cloud honeypot (LocalStack) to detect IAM and storage bucket exploits.
•	RAG-Enhanced Intelligence: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) subsystem, built on Vertex AI Embeddings and Vector Search , indexes MITRE ATT&CK techniques, CVE/NVD summaries, and ExploitDB metadata. This provides the reasoning engine with a semantic threat-intelligence corpus to contextualize incoming attacks.
•	Behavioural Reasoning Engine: Raw logs are normalized into JSON events via regex parsing and entropy classification. Google Gemini models then synthesize these sequences to predict the attacker's next likely step (e.g., privilege escalation or lateral movement).
Optimization & Innovation To address the latency and safety challenges of real-time GenAI deployment, CHIMERA introduces:
•	Automated Containment ("Kill Switch"): Leveraging the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), the system monitors for container-escape precursors. If payload entropy or syscall patterns breach safety thresholds, the ADK agent autonomously freezes the compromised sandbox, preventing host contamination.
•	Explainable AI Dashboard: A centralized visualization layer displays the "Mind of the Machine," showing judges the live correlation between raw attacker commands, retrieved RAG documents, and Gemini’s predicted intent.
Impact By proactively preparing high-fidelity decoys—such as fake SSH keys or vulnerable IAM roles—based on predicted intent, CHIMERA extends engagement duration and uncovers deep behavioural patterns across hybrid infrastructures. This project demonstrates a move from reactive logging to proactive, AI-driven cyber defence.
